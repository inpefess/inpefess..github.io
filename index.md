Hi! My name is Boris. I'm a machine learning and big data professional with 10+ years of experience. Please see my [CV](boris-shminke.pdf) or find me at the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inpefess/).

I obtained my PhD on 01Sep2023 at [Dieudonn√© math lab](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/fiche%26id%3d963.html). Please see my [publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AxWTLt0AAAAJ) on applying artificial intelligence to theorem proving.

My recent projects include
* a collection of OpenAI Gym [environments](https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation) for automated provers
* a Python [client](https://github.com/inpefess/isabelle-client) to Isabelle proof assistant server

I've also contributed to [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20691) and [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/34790).
